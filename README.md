##Summary
You are a ball sitting on the lawn minding your own business and here come the cows!
Avoid the cows by jumping over them.  Be warned, these aren't your average cows...

##How to Play
Cows will run across the screen one at a time.  Click the "spacebar" to jump over them.
That's it!  Cows will progressively move faster.  Jump on the clouds for an extra bounce.

##Technical Details
- Consistent cow generation allows for infinite playing.
- Object oriented programming in JavaScript.
- Integrates a leveling system that creates faster moving cows as you level.
- Uses local storage to keep track of your high score.
- Incorporates gravity for realistic effect of ball in free fall.
