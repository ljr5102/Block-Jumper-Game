## Summary
You are a pig head sitting on the lawn minding your own business and here come the cows!
Avoid the cows by jumping over them.  Be warned, these aren't your average cows...

## How to Play
Cows will run across the screen one at a time.  Tap the "spacebar" or click on the screen to jump over them.
